# CHANGELOG

## 1.3

**What's New:**
 - The `SDCAlertViewTransitioning` protocol allows users to customize alert transitions and behavior
 - `SDCAlertView` now supports `tintColor` for buttons and `contentView`

**Bug Fixes:**
 - Fixes an issue where the status bar style would not be preserved if it was set to `UIStatusBarStyleLightContent` (#26 & #27)
 - Fixes a bug that causes the app to lock up due to a race condition (#28)
 - Adding subviews to `contentView` won't have any animation-related side effects anymore (see #25)

## 1.2.1

**Bug Fixes:**
 - Resolves an issue that could put an app in a bad state when transitioning to and from multiple alerts in rapid succession.

## 1.2

**What's New:**
 - New convenience methods for showing alerts more easily
 - The `SDCAlertViewWidth` constant is made public (#24)
 - The `contentView` does not require vertical constraints anymore, though they can be used to size the `contentView` other than "hug its subviews" (#23)

**Bug Fixes:**
 - Resolves an issue that would show the status bar if it was previously hidden (#21)
 - Resolves an issue that would sometimes return the wrong button index when using `addButtonWithTitle:` (c4af94542253e211bebcb17e9a9dc898a284a209)
 - Transitions between alerts flow more logically if you call several show or dismiss methods right after each other (#25)
 - The `animated` argument in `dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:animated:` is honored again (1bfa04903ffae880a377b3d97ddfed72ad7ff413)

## 1.1

**What's New:**
Support for styling an alert. A number of properties have been exposed so that alerts can be easily given a different style. Styling all alerts in an app using `UIAppearance` is also supported.

**Bug Fixes:**
 - The alert's background is no longer using the toolbar hack (#16 & #17â€”thanks @clstroud!)
 - Accessing a text field before calling `show` does not cause a crash anymore (#14)
 - The color of text on a button color did not match `UIAlertView`'s text color 100%
 - A disabled button will have its label's `enabled` property set to `NO`, which is also where it gets its gray color from
 - A 1px hairline at the bottom of the right button in a two-button alert was removed

## 1.0

This release marks the first official release of SDCAlertView.

SDCAlertView's behavior should now match UIAlertView's. Any behavior that's different from UIAlertView and is not documented as a "won't fix" or known bug is considered a bug that needs to be solved.

## 0.9

Initial release
